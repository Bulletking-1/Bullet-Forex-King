    <h2><i class="fas fa-graduation-cap"></i> Smart Money Concepts</h2>
    <p>Learn how institutional traders approach the market with detailed explanations, visual illustrations, and strategies for practical application.</p>
    
    <div class="content-grid">
      <div class="content-card">
        <h3><i class="fas fa-money-bill-wave"></i> Liquidity Pools</h3>
        <p>Liquidity pools are price levels where a large cluster of pending stop-loss orders are positioned, usually around obvious highs and lows. Institutions target these pools to generate the volume they need for big moves.</p>
        <div class="explanation">
          <p><strong>Trading Tip:</strong> When price aggressively moves into a liquidity pool and immediately rejects, this is a signal that smart money has engineered a liquidity grab. Combine this with structure breaks for higher accuracy entries.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="content-card">
        <h3><i class="fas fa-exchange-alt"></i> Order Blocks</h3>
        <p>An order block is the last bullish or bearish candle before a strong impulsive move. These zones represent areas where institutions placed large orders.</p>
        <div class="explanation">
          <p><strong>Trading Tip:</strong> After a sharp move, price often revisits the origin candle (order block) to mitigate pending institutional orders. Watch for confirmations like rejection wicks, engulfing candles, or lower timeframe break of structure.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="content-card">
        <h3><i class="fas fa-chart-area"></i> Market Structure</h3>
        <p>Market structure is the backbone of technical analysis. It helps traders understand trend direction by analyzing highs and lows (HH, HL, LH, LL).</p>
        <div class="explanation">
          <p><strong>Trading Tip:</strong> Always align with the higher timeframe structure. For example, trade only longs when the daily timeframe is showing bullish structure (HH + HL), and look for CHoCH/BOS on lower timeframes for entry.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="content-card">
        <h3><i class="fas fa-balance-scale"></i> Supply & Demand Zones</h3>
        <p>These zones form when the market leaves behind sharp moves, indicating imbalances. They show where buyers or sellers were strongly in control.</p>
        <div class="explanation">
          <p><strong>Trading Tip:</strong> Entering at demand zones during bullish trends and at supply zones during bearish trends greatly improves risk-to-reward. Wait for price confirmation (candlestick patterns or structure shifts).</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="content-card">
        <h3><i class="fas fa-layer-group"></i> Fair Value Gaps (FVG)</h3>
        <p>A Fair Value Gap is a price imbalance caused by three candles: the first and third do not overlap, leaving a gap. Institutions tend to rebalance these inefficiencies.</p>
        <div class="explanation">
          <p><strong>Trading Tip:</strong> Mark FVGs on the 1H or 4H chart. When price retraces into these zones and rejects, it often continues in the original direction. FVGs also align well with order blocks.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="content-card">
        <h3><i class="fas fa-bullseye"></i> Mitigation Blocks</h3>
        <p>A mitigation block occurs when price revisits a previous order block to close out remaining institutional orders. These levels often provide precise entries.</p>
        <div class="explanation">
          <p><strong>Trading Tip:</strong> Look for mitigation blocks when price returns to a previously violated order block. These setups are best traded with confluence such as BOS/CHoCH and liquidity sweeps.</p>
